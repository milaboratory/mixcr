                             For `.fasta` library will be written in FASTA format with gene name

                             alleleName - result allele name. If it's de nova, then before `-M` is
                               nearest known variant, M{n} is how many mutations in it and CDR3-{n}
                               is how many mutations in CDR3, at the end uniq hash.

                               changed. If enoughInfo is false, then it was found by aligning
                               clones on known variants.
