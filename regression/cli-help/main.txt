  exportClonesOverlap      Build cloneset overlap and export into tab delimited file.
  exportAirr               Exports a clns, clna or vdjca file to Airr formatted tsv file.
Util commands:
  exportReadsForClones       Export reads for particular clones from "clones & alignments" (*.clna)
                               file.
  exportAlignmentsForClones  Export alignments for particular clones from "clones & alignments" (*.
                               clna) file.
  exportReads                Export original reads from vdjca file.
  mergeAlignments            Merge several *.vdjca files with alignments into a single alignments
                               file.
  filterAlignments           Filter alignments.
  sortAlignments             Sort alignments in vdjca file by read id.
  sortClones                 Sort clones by sequence. Clones in the output file will be sorted by
                               clonal sequence, which allows to build overlaps between clonesets.
  alignmentsDiff             Calculates the difference between two .vdjca files.
  clonesDiff                 Calculates the difference between two .clns files.
  versionInfo                Output information about MiXCR version which generated the file.
  slice                      Slice vdjca|clns|clna|shmt file.
  exportPreset               Export a preset file given the preset name or source file and a set of
                               mix-ins
  buildLibrary               Build custom reference library
  mergeLibrary               Merge multiple reference libraries in one file
  listPresets                Show all available presets
