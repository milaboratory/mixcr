                               if there are non-trimmed adapter sequences at 5'-end. Optional
                               <anchor_point> may be specified to instruct MiXCR where the primer
                               is located and strip V feature to align accordingly, resulting in a

                               Optional <anchor_point> may be specified to instruct MiXCR how to

                               or if there are non-trimmed adapter sequences at 3'-end. Requires
                               either gene type (`J` for J primers / `C` for C primers) or
                               <anchor_point> to be specified. In latter case MiXCR will
                               additionally strip feature to align accordingly.
