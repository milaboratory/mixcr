## Key changes

- implemented QC [TODO]
- new alignment

## Major changes & new features

- special mechanism to allow for `NaN` values in metrics in group filters (used in `minSequenceCount` parameter in k-mer filter, see below)
- adds new `minSequenceCount` parameter for k-mer filter, allowing construction of more flexible filtering pipelines with better fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries
- now full sample sheet with input file names can be provided as an input to the pipeline
- now sample sheets provided both with `--sample-table` mixin and as a pipeline input, will be fuzzy matched against the data, allowing for one substitutions in unambiguous cases. This behaviour can be turned off by using `--sample-table-strict` mixin instead, or by adding a `--strict-sample-sheet-matching` option if full sample sheet input is used as pipeline input.
- official Docker image migrated from Eclipse Temurin JDK to Amazon Corretto JDK (see breaking changes section below)
- better compatibility of official docker image with Nextflow
- new convenient commands to build custom libraries (`mixcr buildLibrary` and `mixcr mergeLibrary`) 
- fixes connected to quality scores processing in several parts of the pipeline:
  - tag refinement now uses average quality in statistical inference; this is the correct approach from the mathematical point of view, and it slightly increases performance judging by better consensus assembly downstream
  - statistical inference in PCR error correction redone from scratch, now it takes into account aggregated quality scores of clonotypes, which makes the procedure automatically adapt to low quality samples and better perform in many marginal cases in both UMI and non-UMI protocols 
  - better algorithm for quality score aggregation in clonotype assembly
  - better algorithm for quality score aggregation in consensus assembly
- mechanism to apply different tag transformations on the `align` step. Transformations include mappings, string and sequence manipulations and various arithmetic operations. This feature allows to fit single-cell scenarios where multiple well-known barcodes marks the same cell, allows to convert sequence barcodes to textual representation to adopt different barcode naming schemas used in some protocols, convert multiple barcodes to single cell id. Feature is currently used in presets for analysis of data from Parse Bioscience and BD Rhapsody single-cell platforms.
- Preset-specific quality control metrics added.

## Major fixes

- fix for naming of intermediate files and reports produced by `analyze` if target folder is specified
- tag pattern now is also searched in reverse strand for single-ended input with `--tag-parse-unstranded`

## Braking changes

- parameter `clusteringFilter.specificMutationProbability` removed from `assemble` action, three new parameters are introduced instead:
  - `clusteringFilter.correctionPower` - this parameter determines how thorough the procedure should eliminate erroneous variants. Smaller value leaves less erroneous variants at the cost of accidentally correcting true variants. This value approximates the fraction of erroneous variants the algorithm will miss (type II errors).
  - `clusteringFilter.backgroundSubstitutionRate` - expected rate of substitutions happening before the sequencing
  - `clusteringFilter.backgroundIndelRate` - expected rate of indels happening before the sequencing
- Official Docker image has two important changes:

  - Custom entry-point of the image removed, and now is set to `/bin/bash`
  
    One now needs to specify `mixcr` command at the beginning of argument list:
    
    Old: `docker run ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr analyze ...`
    
    New: `docker run ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr mixcr analyze ...`

  - New image is based on Amazon Corretto which in turn is based on Amazon Linux 2. If customization is required for the image, one now need to use `yum` package manager instead of `apt`/`apt-get`. 

    With old image:

    ```
    FROM ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr:4.3.2
    ...
    RUN apt-get install -y wget
    ...
    ```

    With new image:

    ```
    FROM ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr:4.4.0
    ...
    RUN yum install -y wget
    ...
    ```
