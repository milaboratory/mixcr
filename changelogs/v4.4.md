## Key changes

- implemented QC [TODO]
- new alignment

## Major changes & new features

- special mechanism to allow for `NaN` values in metrics in group filters (used in `minSequenceCount` parameter in k-mer filter, see below)
- adds new `minSequenceCount` parameter for k-mer filter, allowing construction of more flexible filtering pipelines with better fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries
- now full sample sheet with input file names can be provided as an input to the pipeline
- now sample sheets provided both with `--sample-table` mixin and as a pipeline input, will be fuzzy matched against the data, allowing for one substitutions in unambiguous cases. This behaviour can be turned off by using `--sample-table-strict` mixin instead, or by adding a `--strict-sample-sheet-matching` option if full sample sheet input is used as pipeline input.
- official Docker image migrated from Eclipse Temurin JDK to Amazon Corretto JDK (see breaking changes section below)
- better compatibility of official docker image with Nextflow
- new convenient commands to build custom libraries (`mixcr buildLibrary` and `mixcr mergeLibrary`) 

## Major fixes

- fix for naming of intermediate files and reports produced by `analyze` if target folder is specified
- tag pattern now is also searched in reverse strand for single-ended input with `--tag-parse-unstranded`

## Preset changes

- added fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries for `10x-vdj-bcr` preset

## Minor fixes and improvements

- added gene feature coverage in alignment report
- on Linux platforms default calculation of -Xmx now based on "available" memory (previously "free" was used)
- new gene aligner parameter `edgeRealignmentMinScoreOverride` for more sensitive alignments for short paired-end reads
- report values downstream `align` now calculate percents relative to the number of reads in the sample rather than the total number of reads in multi-sample analysis
- options helping with advanced analysis of data quality and consensus assembly process added to `assemble` (`--consensus-alignments`, `--consensus-state-stat`, `--downsample-consensus-state-stat`) and `analyze` (`--output-consensus-alignments`, `--output-consensus-state-stat`, `--downsample-consensus-state-stat`)
- fixed bug not allowing to parse more than two reads with tag pattern
- better tag pattern search projection representation in reports
- fix for value in report line `Reads dropped due to low quality, percent of total report string`
- additional report string "Aligned reads processed" in `assemble` report
- fix bug when `--chains` is used with `exportClonesOverlap` 
- fix for `export...` - tag quality field added back to export columns
- fixes bug not allowing to use more than 2 input reads in pattern matching

## Braking changes

- Official Docker image has two important changes:

  - Custom entry-point of the image removed, and now is set to `/bin/bash`
  
    One now needs to specify `mixcr` command at the beginning of argument list:
    
    Old: `docker run ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr analyze ...`
    
    New: `docker run ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr mixcr analyze ...`

  - New image is based on Amazon Corretto which in turn is based on Amazon Linux 2. If customization is required for the image, one now need to use `yum` package manager instead of `apt`/`apt-get`. 

    With old image:

    ```
    FROM ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr:4.3.2
    ...
    RUN apt-get install -y wget
    ...
    ```

    With new image:

    ```
    FROM ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr:4.4.0
    ...
    RUN yum install -y wget
    ...
    ```
