## Major features

- special mechanism to allow for NaN values in metrics in group filters (i.e. used in `minSequenceCount` parameter in k-mer filter, see below)
- adds new `minSequenceCount` parameter for k-mer filter, allowing construction of more flexible filtering pipelines with better fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries

## Preset changes

- added fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries for `10x-vdj-bcr` preset

## Minor fixes and improvements

- new gene aligner parameter `edgeRealignmentMinScoreOverride` for more sensitive alignments for short paired-end reads 
- fix bug when `--chains` is used with `exportClonesOverlap` 
- fix for `export...` - tag quality field added back to export columns
- fixes bug not allowing to use more than 2 input reads in pattern matching
