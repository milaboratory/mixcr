# Major changes

- Command `findShmTrees` now can build trees from inputs with different tags.
- Added `--impute-germline-on-export` and `--dont-impute-germline-on-export` to `exportAlignments` and `exportClones`
  commands

# Minor improvements

- Now, instead of specifying separately multiple tags of the same type (i.e. CELL1+CELL2+CELL3) in filters, one can use convenient aliases (like `allTags:Cell`, `allTags:Molecule`). This also facilitates creation of more generic base preset implementing common single-cell and UMI filtering strategies. 

# Fixes

- fixes bug with `saveOriginalReads=true` on `align` leading to errors down the pipeline
- `analyze` now correctly terminates on first error
- correct progress reporting in `align` with multiple input files are use with file name expansion
