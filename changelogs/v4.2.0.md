# Overview

This release brings full support of sample barcodes in MiXCR pipeline. Sample barcodes can be picked up and processed
from all possible sources (`I1`/`I2` files, sequence header lines, from inside the tag pattern, etc...). Processing can
be done in two principal modes in respect to sample barcodes: (1) data can be split by samples right on the `align`
stage and processed separately, or (2) all samples can be processed as a single set of sequences and separated only on
the very last `exportClones` step, both approaches have their pros and cons allowing to use the best strategy given the
experimental setup and study goals.

# Major changes

- presets for BD Rhapsody TCR and BCR full length protocols
- preset for Nanopore protocol
- preset for Smart-Seq2 protocol
- preset with align parameters for long-reads data
- support for more than two `fastq` files as input (`I1` and `I2` reads support)
- multiple possible sources of data for sample resolution:
    - sequences extracted with tag pattern (including those coming from `I1` and `I2` reads)
    - samples can be based on specific pattern variant (with multi-variant patterns, separated by `||`, allows to easily
      adopt MiGEC-style sample files)
    - [TBD] strings extracted from fastq description line
    - parts of file names (extracted using file name expansion mechanism)
- flexible sample table matching criteria
    - matching multiple tags
    - matching variant id from multi-variant tag patterns
- special `--sample-table` mixin option allowing for flexible sample table definition in a tab-delimited table form
- special `--infer-sample-table` mixin option to infer sample table for sample tags from file name expansion
- special generic presets for multiplexed data analysis scenarios (e.g. `generic-tcr-amplicon-separate-samples-umi`)
- `align` command now optionally allows to split output alignments by sample into separate `vdjca` files
- `exportClones` command now supports splitting the output into multiple files by sample
- `analyze` command supports new splitting behaviour of the `align` command, separately running all the analysis steps
  for all the output files (if splitting is enabled)
- preset for 10X VDJ BCR enhanced with k-mer-based filter to eliminate rare cross-cell contamination from plasmatic
  cells
- added command `exportReportsTable` that prints file in tabular format with report data from commands that were run
- fixed system temp folder detection behaviour, now mixcr respects `TMPDIR` environment variable
- rework of preset-mixin logic, now external presets (like those starting from `local:...`) are packed into the output
  `*.vdjca` file on `align` step, the same applies to all externally linked information, like tag whitelists and
  sample lists. This behaviour facilitates better analysis reproducibility and more transparent parameter logistics.
- new mixin options to adjust tag refinement whitelists with `analyze`: `--set-whitelist` and `--reset-whitelist`
- removed `refineTagsAndSort` options `-w` and `--whitelist`; corresponding deprecation error message printed if used
- new grouping feature for `exportClones`, allowing to normalize values for `-readFraction` and `-uniqueTagFraction ...`
  columns to totals for certain compartments instead of normalizing to the whole dataset. This feature allows to output
  e.g. fractions of reads inside the cell.
- new mixin options `--add-export-clone-table-splitting`, `--reset-export-clone-table-splitting`,
  `--add-export-clone-grouping` and `--reset-export-clone-grouping`
- improved sensitivity of `findAlleles` command
- default trimming parameters changed (`trimmingQualityThreshold` changed from `0` to `10`), this setting showed better
  performance in many real world use-cases
- reference V/D/J/C gene library upgrade to repseqio v2.1 (
  see [changelog](https://github.com/repseqio/library/releases/tag/v2.1))
- rework of clustering step aimed at PCR / reverse-transcription error correction in `assemble`, now it correctly
  handles
  any possible tag combination (sample, cell or molecule)
- new advanced thresholding algorithm from the paper by [J. Barron (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07350) allows for 
  better automated histogram thresholding in barcoded data filtering
- new feature to add histogram preprocessing steps in automated thresholding

# Minor changes & fixes

- add tags info in `exportAlignmentsPretty` and `exportClonesPretty`
- add `--chains` filter for `exportShmTrees`, `exportShmTreesWithNodes`, `exportShmTreesNewick`
  and `exportPlots shmTrees` commands
- fixed old bug #353, now all aligners favor leftmost J gene in situations where multiple genes can ve found in the
  sequence (i.e. mis-spliced mRNA)
- fixes exception in `align` happening for not-parsed sequences with `writeFailedAlignments=true`
- new filter and parameter added in `assemblePartial`; parameter name is `minimalNOverlapShare`, it controls minimal
  relative part of N region that must be covered by the overlap to conclude that two reads are from the same V(D)J
  rearrangement
- default paired-end overlap parameters changed to slightly more relaxed version
- better criteria for alignments to be accepted for the `assemblePartial` procedure
- fixed NPE in `assemblePartial` executed for the data without C-gene alignment settings
- fixed rare exception in `exportAirr` command
- by default exports show messages like 'region_not_covered' for data that can't be extracted (requesting `-nFeature`
  for not covered region or not existed tag). Option `--not-covered-as-empty` will save previous behaviour
- info about genes with enough data to find allele was added into report of `findAlleles` and description of alleles
- fixed error message appearing when analysis parameter already assigned to `null` is overridden by `null` using
  the `-O...` option
- fixed wrong reporting of number of trimmed letters from the right side of R1 and R2 sequence
- fixed error message about repeated generic mixin overrides
- fixed error of `exportClones` with some arguments
- fixes for report indention artefacts
- fixed bug when chains filter set to `ALL` in `exportAlignments` was preventing not-aligned records to be exported
- fixed runtime exception in `assemble` rising in analysis of data with CELL barcodes but without UMIs, with turned off
  consensus assembly
- fixed bug leading to incorrect mixin option ordering during it's application to parameters bundle
- minor change to the contigAssembly filtering parametrization
- added mix-in `--export-productive-clones-only`
- warning message about automatically set `-Xmx..` JVM option in `mixcr` script
- safer automatic value for `-Xms..`
- added `species` flag to 10x, nanopore and smart-seq2 presets
