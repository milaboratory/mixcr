     * nucleotide in exactly this position, it is not the same as if the sequence had all low quality positions and you
     * found the clonotype differing in one of them. In the first case you had only 3 possible sequences to match with,
     * and in the second case - 3*L, where L is the length of the clonal sequence. To address for this effect, MiXCR
     * controls the number of possible matching sequence, instead of a raw number of allowed mismatches.
