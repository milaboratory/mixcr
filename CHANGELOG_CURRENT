New command ``assembleContigs`` for assembling full TCR/IG receptor sequences
New command ``analyze`` for running complicated pipelines with one single command. Two pipelines which cover most practical cases are implemented ``analyze amplicon`` and ``analyze shotgun``
New file format ``.clna`` for storing clones with alignments including alignments <> clones mapping
Replace ``extendAlignments`` with ``extend`` command which works both with alignments and clones
Complete refactoring of command line interface
New option ``--resume`` for resuming aborted / partially completed execution
Implemented ``-nFeatureImputed`` and ``-aaFeatureImputed`` export fields which use germline sequences (marked lowercase) for uncovered receptor regions
Implementation of compressed `.vdjca` files
Species option ``--species`` is now mandatory #342
Removed ``--chains`` option for align #292
Added export field ``-positionInReference``
Now export fields like `-nMutationsRelative` supports alignment-attached gene features (e.g. this allows to export all mutations of V gene inside CDR3 region: `-nMutationsRelative VCDR3Part VRegionWithP`)
Now `align` action prints library-level warnings and citation notice
Refactored command line interface of `exportReadsForClones`
minor: fixes for #292 #280 #279 #208 #203 #421
minor: `--noMerge` option renamed to `--no-merge` in assemble action
