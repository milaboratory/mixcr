# Diversity and Biophysics plots: added ability to select specific primary and secondary group values and their order with `--primary-group-values`, -pv` and `--secondary-group-values`, -sv`. Example: `mixcr exportPlots diversity -p tissue -pv Spleen,Thymus,PBMC,LymphNode -s condition -sv Before,After`
# Bugfix in V- / J- / VJ- usage tabular output
# `exportClonesOverlap`: fix bug with ignored option `--only-productive`
# Dropped functionality used to avoid re-running of some MiXCR commands when re-analyzing the data as unstable
# Removed `pipelineInfo` command
# Save all MiXCR reports: now possible to export reports directly from vdjca/clns/clna files using `mixcr exportReports --json alignments.vdjca reports.jsonl`
# Added basic QC plots for alignment rate, chain usage, read coverage; see `mixcr exportQc help`
