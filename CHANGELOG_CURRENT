V/J chimera detection and elimination mechanism; new parameter `minChimeraDetectionScore` both alignments in R1 and R2 should be greater than this value
Smarter second fine alignment step, new parameter `alignmentBoundaryTolerance`, now this mechanism is triggered even if alignment boundary not perfectly matches read boundary in the opposite mate-pair; minor bug fixes
Fixed `NPE` in VDJCHit#getIdentity. Commands like `mixcr exportClones ... -cBestIdentityPercent ...` affected
New `align` action report line added `No target with both V and J alignments`; fix for inaccurate value for `Alignment failed because of low total score`
Enable asserts for non-release builds, increases chance of detecting subtile error conditions, by trading-off some performance; has no effect on release builds
