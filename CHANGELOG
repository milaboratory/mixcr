-- Also several minor fixes to the overal logic of `analyze`
-- Fix for exported clonotype tables for specific receptor chains in `analyze` (#454)
-- `--no-export` option added to `analyze` action (#454)

-- Additional fix for error in `exportAlignments` / `exportClones` with repeated non-parametrized 
   options
-- Added support for affine alignments in `assembleContigs`


MiXCR 3.0.1 (25 Oct 2018)
========================

-- This fixes problem with repeated CLI options in export
-- `VRegionWithP` now is used as `featureToAlign` for V gene
-- `VTranscriptWithP` instead of `VTranscriptWithout5UTRWithP` used for RNA-Seq parameters
-- Rename `-sequence` to `-targetSequences` and `-quality` to `-targetQualities` in export #298
-- Minor cosmetics for clone ordering #401


MiXCR 3.0 (23 Oct 2018)
========================

-- New command ``assembleContigs`` for assembling longest possible contig TCR/IG receptor sequences 
   from several intersecting sequences containing clonal sequence. E.g. assemble all possible sequence 
   information outside CDR3.
-- New command ``analyze`` for running optimized mixcr pipelines with one single command. Two 
   pipelines which cover most practical cases are implemented ``analyze amplicon`` and ``analyze 
   shotgun``.
-- New file format ``.clna`` for storing clones with alignments including alignments <> clones 
   mapping
-- Complete refactoring of command line interface
-- New option ``--resume`` for resuming aborted / partially completed execution
-- Implemented ``-nFeatureImputed`` and ``-aaFeatureImputed`` to export gene feature sequences 
   imputing unavailable regions from germline sequences up to the full feature sequecn (marking 
   imputed regions lowercase)
-- LZ4 based compression `.vdjca`/`.clna` files, 3 ~ 4 fold file size reduction (built into file 
   formats, enabled by default)
-- Species option ``--species`` is now mandatory #342
-- Removed ``--chains`` option for `align` action #292
-- Added export field ``-positionInReference``
-- Now export fields like `-nMutationsRelative` supports alignment-attached gene features (e.g. 
   this allows to export all mutations of V gene inside CDR3 sub-regions: `-nMutationsRelative 
   VCDR3Part VRegionWithP`)
-- Now `align` action prints library-level warnings and citation notice
-- Refactored command line interface of `exportReadsForClones`
-- Dropped support for Java 7
-- minor: fixes for #292 #280 #279 #208 #203 #421
-- minor: `--noMerge` option renamed to `--no-merge` in assemble action


MiXCR 2.1.12 (22 Aug 2018)
========================

-- Fixes rare inconsistency in behaviour between paired-end and single-end aligners, clone 
   assembler and partial sequence assembler in respect to target D gene set selection based on the 
   chains on V, J and C genes (#408)

   library


MiXCR 2.1.10 (30 Mar 2018)
========================

-- Chain distribution is back in report file
-- V/J chimera detection and elimination mechanism; new parameter `minChimeraDetectionScore` both 
   alignments in R1 and R2 should be greater than this value
-- Smarter second fine alignment step, new parameter `alignmentBoundaryTolerance`, now this 
   mechanism is triggered even if alignment boundary not perfectly matches read boundary in the 
   opposite mate-pair; minor bug fixes
-- Fixed `NPE` in VDJCHit#getIdentity. Commands like `mixcr exportClones ... -cBestIdentityPercent 
   ...` affected
-- New `align` action report line added `No target with both V and J alignments`; fix for 
   inaccurate value for `Alignment failed because of low total score`
-- Enable asserts for non-release builds, increases chance of detecting subtile error conditions, 
   by trading-off some performance; has no effect on release builds


MiXCR 2.1.9 ( 7 Feb 2018)
========================

-- Built-in library upgrade to v1.5, many fixes, new species *Nannospalax galili* (see library

MiXCR 2.1.7 ( 6 Dec 2017)
========================

-- Fixes bug leading to IOException if report file not exists. (#295)


MiXCR 2.1.6 (28 Nov 2017)
========================

-- *(beta)* Added JSON-formatted reports. Use `--json-report` option in `align`, 
   `extendAlignments`, `assemblePartial` or `assemble` actions to create JSON report or append it to 
   already existing report file ([jsonl](http://jsonlines.org/)). This feature is intended to simplify 
   batch analysis, and analysis automation. E.g. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) util can be used 
   to aggregate information from multi-json-report files.
-- Report file appends are made atomic. Now you can safely specify the same report file name in 
   several invocations of MiXCR, even if you run several instances of MiXCR in parallel. Should also 
   work for NFS and other remote FS, suppporting file locking.
-- Added chains column in export (`-chains` and `-topChains`)
-- minor: Several new counters added to `align` report
-- minor: Added proper filtering for alleles with wildcard symbols in `featureToAlign` region

========================

-- Additional check for the same V hits in merging sequences in `assemblePartial`

-- Not aligned mates from fully aligned opposite PE reads are now taken into `assemblePartial` 
   procedure (case when V and J parts of the target read are shorter than 12 nt)

   reads are also taken into account
-- More sophisticated algorithm for alignment-guided merging of paired-end reads in `align`
-- Several anchor point positions in export points changed their meaning.
-- Fixed absent space in `AA. Seq. ...` column name and excessive space in the end of several 
   column names (affects `exportClones` and `exportAlignments` with `-v` option; fixes compatibility 
   with VDJTools v1.1.3 and below).
-- Fixes NPE in `exportClones` in some cases with mmu reference
-- `-p` option in `assemblePartial` enabled by default; deprecated; will be removed in 2.2
-- Added `-d` option in `assemblePartial` to drop non-assembled partial reads to reduce output file 
   size
-- Added `sortAlignments` action. Sort `*.vdjca` files by read id, allows diffing alignments after 
   `assembleParial` and other actions that shuffle records inside file.
-- Fixed incorrect behaviour of `exportClones` and `exportAlignments` in cases like `mixcr 
   exportAlignments -p full -descrR1 ...`
-- minor: Multiple reads in `exportAlignmentsPretty` and `filterAlignments` should be now specified 
   as `-i 123 -i 456` or `-i 123,456` etc.
-- minor: `--reads-ids` in `exportAlignmentsPretty` and `--readsIds` in `filterAlignments` both 
   renamed to `--read-ids`
-- minor: infrastructure for post-build tests in Travis CI


MiXCR 2.1 ( 6 Feb 2017)
========================

   TCR/IG extraction substantially improved (according to our benchmarks, efficiency is highest among 
   all tools available for RNA-Seq repertoire extraction known to date; successfully work even for 
   48+48 RNA-Seq data). Zero false-positive alignments and false-overlaps detected.
-- Additional round of alignment for V gene in paired-end reads aligner (improve efficiency and 
   accuracy for some boundary cases; negligible impact on analysis speed).
-- New action `extendAlignments` to extend TCR alignments with defined V and J genes but not fully 
   covering CDR3 sequence.
-- Scripting-friendly export format now used by default. Use `-v` to return to column names with 
   spaces.

   now is explicitly exported in `-defaultAnchorPoints` field (see docs for more info).

MiXCR 2.0.3 (26 Dec 2016)
========================

-- User-friendly export of mutations in germline sequences: nucleotide, amino-acid and detailed 
   (provides means to link nucleotide mutations with resulting amino-acid mutations; e.g. it allows to 
   easy differentiate between sense and nonsense nucleotide mutations). Mutations can be exported for 
   any gene feature (e.g. FR3) realtive to any gene feature (e.g. VRegion).
-- Fix for NPE in assemble action invoked with `-OmaxBadPointsPercent=0`
-- Support for Linux `free` version 3.3.10 in `mixcr` wrapper script (now MiXCR runs on Centos 7.2, 
   Ubuntu 16.04.1)

-- Clone assembler now can separates clones with different V/J/C genes but same clonal sequence
