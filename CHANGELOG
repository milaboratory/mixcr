MiXCR 2.1.10 (30 Mar 2018)
========================

-- Chain distribution is back in report file
-- V/J chimera detection and elimination mechanism; new parameter `minChimeraDetectionScore` both 
   alignments in R1 and R2 should be greater than this value
-- Smarter second fine alignment step, new parameter `alignmentBoundaryTolerance`, now this 
   mechanism is triggered even if alignment boundary not perfectly matches read boundary in the 
   opposite mate-pair; minor bug fixes
-- Fixed `NPE` in VDJCHit#getIdentity. Commands like `mixcr exportClones ... -cBestIdentityPercent 
   ...` affected
-- New `align` action report line added `No target with both V and J alignments`; fix for 
   inaccurate value for `Alignment failed because of low total score`
-- Enable asserts for non-release builds, increases chance of detecting subtile error conditions, 
   by trading-off some performance; has no effect on release builds


MiXCR 2.1.9 ( 7 Feb 2018)
========================

-- Built-in library upgrade to v1.5, many fixes, new species *Nannospalax galili* (see library 
   release notes for complete list of changes)
-- Fix wrong number of chimeric alignments in report with --write-all option
-- Remove wrong `-v` in text warnings in align action
-- Drpped out-of-the-box support for files produced with repseq.io libraries v1.0 and 1.1


MiXCR 2.1.8 (22 Dec 2017)
========================

-- Fixes possible `IOException` during report output on Lustre file system


MiXCR 2.1.7 ( 6 Dec 2017)
========================

-- Fixes bug leading to IOException if report file not exists. (#295)


MiXCR 2.1.6 (28 Nov 2017)
========================

-- *(beta)* Added JSON-formatted reports. Use `--json-report` option in `align`, 
   `extendAlignments`, `assemblePartial` or `assemble` actions to create JSON report or append it to 
   already existing report file ([jsonl](http://jsonlines.org/)). This feature is intended to simplify 
   batch analysis, and analysis automation. E.g. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) util can be used 
   to aggregate information from multi-json-report files.
-- Report file appends are made atomic. Now you can safely specify the same report file name in 
   several invocations of MiXCR, even if you run several instances of MiXCR in parallel. Should also 
   work for NFS and other remote FS, suppporting file locking.
-- Added chains column in export (`-chains` and `-topChains`)
-- minor: Several new counters added to `align` report
-- minor: Added proper filtering for alleles with wildcard symbols in `featureToAlign` region
-- minor: Fixed bug in align report (wrong total count in rare cases) #265

   `kaligner2`.


MiXCR 2.1.4 (24 Jul 2017)
========================

-- RepSeq.IO updated to 1.2.9, default built-in library updated to 1.4 (read library changelog 
   [here](https://github.com/repseqio/library/releases/tag/v1.3) and 
   [here](https://github.com/repseqio/library/releases/tag/v1.4)).

========================

-- Additional check for the same V hits in merging sequences in `assemblePartial`
-- Fix: list of C hits limited by `relativeMinScore` in `assemblePartial`
-- Not aligned mates from fully aligned opposite PE reads are now taken into `assemblePartial` 
   procedure (case when V and J parts of the target read are shorter than 12 nt)
-- Additional consistency cehcks in `assemblePartial`, overlaps of non-CDR3-covering mates of PE 
   reads are also taken into account
-- More sophisticated algorithm for alignment-guided merging of paired-end reads in `align`
-- Several anchor point positions in export points changed their meaning.
-- Fixed absent space in `AA. Seq. ...` column name and excessive space in the end of several 
   column names (affects `exportClones` and `exportAlignments` with `-v` option; fixes compatibility 
   with VDJTools v1.1.3 and below).
-- Fixes NPE in `exportClones` in some cases with mmu reference
-- `-p` option in `assemblePartial` enabled by default; deprecated; will be removed in 2.2
-- Added `-d` option in `assemblePartial` to drop non-assembled partial reads to reduce output file 
   size
-- Added `sortAlignments` action. Sort `*.vdjca` files by read id, allows diffing alignments after 
   `assembleParial` and other actions that shuffle records inside file.
-- Fixed incorrect behaviour of `exportClones` and `exportAlignments` in cases like `mixcr 
   exportAlignments -p full -descrR1 ...`
-- minor: Multiple reads in `exportAlignmentsPretty` and `filterAlignments` should be now specified 
   as `-i 123 -i 456` or `-i 123,456` etc.
-- minor: `--reads-ids` in `exportAlignmentsPretty` and `--readsIds` in `filterAlignments` both 
   renamed to `--read-ids`
-- minor: infrastructure for post-build tests in Travis CI


MiXCR 2.1 ( 6 Feb 2017)

   TCR/IG extraction substantially improved (according to our benchmarks, efficiency is highest among 
   all tools available for RNA-Seq repertoire extraction known to date; successfully work even for 
   48+48 RNA-Seq data). Zero false-positive alignments and false-overlaps detected.
-- Additional round of alignment for V gene in paired-end reads aligner (improve efficiency and 
   accuracy for some boundary cases; negligible impact on analysis speed).
-- New action `extendAlignments` to extend TCR alignments with defined V and J genes but not fully 
   covering CDR3 sequence.
-- Scripting-friendly export format now used by default. Use `-v` to return to column names with 
   spaces.

   now is explicitly exported in `-defaultAnchorPoints` field (see docs for more info).

MiXCR 2.0.3 (26 Dec 2016)
========================

   (provides means to link nucleotide mutations with resulting amino-acid mutations; e.g. it allows to 
   easy differentiate between sense and nonsense nucleotide mutations). Mutations can be exported for 
   any gene feature (e.g. FR3) realtive to any gene feature (e.g. VRegion).
-- Fix for NPE in assemble action invoked with `-OmaxBadPointsPercent=0`
-- Support for Linux `free` version 3.3.10 in `mixcr` wrapper script (now MiXCR runs on Centos 7.2, 
   Ubuntu 16.04.1)
